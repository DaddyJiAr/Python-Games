Games made with pygame

There are 2 games in this repository. tutorial.py is not so much of a game, its like the barebones of a game.
I haven't tried to continue it since the tutorial was terrible and I'm lazy. game.py is also a game from a 
tutorial however pong.py is not. There is a .exe file for game.py inside the dist folder because why not.
